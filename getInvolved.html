    <section id="mainBody">
        <p>You are welcome to support our efforts by joining our work parties, nature walks, and project tours. (As a non-profit, we also accept donations.)</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Our current schedule of activities is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work Party: Wednesday, 8/3 from 9-12am,</li>
            <li>Nature Walk: Sunday, 8/7 from 8:30-10:30am,</li>
            <li>Project Tour: Tuesday, 8/16 from 6-7pm,</li>

            <li>Work Party: Wednesday, 9/7 from 9-12am.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>The Nature Walks:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>During our nature walks we focus primarily on birds and their habitat along the creek. This includes the food they eat, their nesting materials and nest sites, and of course the creatures that eat them as well. This means we are interested in the whole ecosystem and all its interactions. These walks are a way to share our joy, love, and respect for native life with you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our walks are co-sponsored by Seattle Audubon Society. Additional directions and more details are available via the following link:
        <br>
        <br>
        Look for the walk entitled:  <a href="https://seattleaudubon.org/get-involved/go-birding/neighborhood-bird-outings/" target="_blank">"Birds and Habitat - along Arboretum Creek"</a></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>The Project Tours:</h1>
        <br>
        <P>Our project tours focus on showing the proposed locations for collecting, cleaning, and conveying (via underground pipes), spring, storm, and pond water into the headwaters of Arboretum Creek.</P>
        <br>
        <p>We will meet in front of the Japanese Garden. Our walk will include about 1 mile of gravel paths and sidewalks. Primarily, along 28th Ave. E. and next to Lake Washington Blvd. Comfortable walking shoes are suggested.</P>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>The Work Parties:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Matthew Hilliard, Gardener Extraordinaire, from Seattle Parks and Recreation, guides and teaches us about the native plants while we work. We also work with the generous support of the Arboretum Foundation who manages our sign up process.

        <h1>Donations:</h1>
