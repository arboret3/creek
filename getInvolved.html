        <br>
        <h1>Nature Walks:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>During our nature walks we focus primarily on birds and their habitat along the creek. This includes the food they eat, their nesting materials and nest sites, and of course the creatures that eat them as well. This means we are interested in the whole ecosystem and all its interactions. These walks are a way to share our joy, love, and respect for native life with you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our walks are co-sponsored by Seattle Audubon Society. They are normally scheduled for the first Sunday of each month. Directions and details are available via the following link. Look for the walk titled:
